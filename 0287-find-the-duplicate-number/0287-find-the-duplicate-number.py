        - The most optimal solution for this porblem is using Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm
        - Basically if a number is repeated in the array, we can consider it as a graph/ linked list and 
        traverse through it and make a cycle out of it at some point
        - Eg. nums = 3, 1, 3, 4, 2: nums[0] -> 3: nums[3] -> 4: nums[4] -> 2: nums[2] -> 3 after this
        point it will start to go in cycles as a result we will use the Torotoise and Hare algorithm           to get the point where the cycle is created which give us the repeated number
